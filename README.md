# Gesture Detection Using Particle Argon and Qwiic Accelerometer

## Project Overview
This project implements a gesture detection system using the Particle Argon microcontroller in combination with a Qwiic-based accelerometer (MMA8452Q). The aim is to detect basic gestures (up, down, left, right) and send this information to the Particle cloud. The system also extends to recognize more complex gestures, such as drawing letters in the air.

## Features
- Detects four basic gestures using accelerometer data.
- Provides visual feedback via a tri-color LED for each detected gesture.
- Sends detected gestures to the Particle cloud for real-time monitoring.
- Supports recognition of more complex gestures, including letters drawn in the air.

## Hardware Components
- **Particle Argon**: Microcontroller for executing the program and interfacing with sensors.
- **Qwiic Grove Shield**: Interface for connecting the accelerometer and LED.
- **Qwiic Accelerometer (MMA8452Q)**: Sensor for motion detection.
- **Grove Chainable LED**: Visual feedback mechanism for gesture detection.
- **Qwiic Cable**: For connecting components.

## Software Requirements
- **Particle IDE**: Development environment for programming the Particle Argon.
- **MMA8452Q Library**: Library for interfacing with the MMA8452Q accelerometer.
